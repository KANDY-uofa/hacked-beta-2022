# Data Analysis on Vehicle Collision
###### A project written at
#### HackED Beta 2022,
###### a 24-hour hackathon hosted by
#### University of Alberta Computer Engineering Club


## Our underlying goal was to raise awareness on **road safety**, especially in **Alberta, Canada**. 
###To do so, we _compiled_ relevant data for wider public accessibility, _analyzed_ government-provided data sets to illustrate a trend in car collisions, and _displayed_ aforementioned data through various displaying techniques in a website.

## Funtionality (C.A.D.)
- **C**ompiles information through web scraping
    - Scrapes news report data from a website whose approach is one of the most systematic and thorough in recording locations of car collision:
        - https://www.navbug.com/alberta_traffic.htm

- **A**nalyzes government-provided data on car collisions through machine learning
    - Uses two training models (ARIMA and Prophet) to analyze the trend and to predict the number of collisions

- **D**isplays above data through displaying techniques on website

---
## Our noteworthy achievements 
- Quickly familiarized ourselves with techniques required to compile, analyze, and display data (i.e., **machine learning**, **web scraping**, and **designing websites**)
- Completed the working project within 24 hours

## Steps to run the program
- **Scraping website data**
    1. Move to "webscraping" directory
    2. To start the program and to create an output file, run:
    ```
    python3 web_scraper.py > scraped_data.txt
    ```

## Background information of contents
- "ARIMA_Prediction_Model" directory
- "Prophet_Prediction_Model" directory
- "dataset" directory
- "webscraping" directory contains files that scrape website data
